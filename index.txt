<br>The last decade has seen an increasing interaction between
theoretical physics, combinatorics and probability theory, concerning
the study and applications of exactly solvable models of statistical
mechanics, with a number of spectacular developments.  

<br><br> As examples of such constructive interplay, let us mention:
dimer models, random surfaces and limit shape phenomena; random
tilings, random partitions and stochastic growth processes; random
tilings and representation theory; Schramm-Loewner evolution and
Conformal Field Theory; the recently developed idea of discrete
holomorphicity; a rigorous characterization of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang
universality class; classical problems in combinatorics, such as the
enumeration of Alternating Sign Matrices and plane partitions; the
Razumov-Stroganov correspondence; lattice supersymmetry, and in
particular, supersymmetric quantum spin chains.  

<br><br> The purpose of this eight weeks programme is to bring
together theoretical and mathematical physicists with expertise in
probability theory, analysis, integrable systems, combinatorics and
representation theory, to boost further advances in the field.
<br><br>

Main topics:
<br>
<br>- Random tilings and limit-shape phenomena 
<br>- Random matrices, determinantal processes and KPZ universality class 
<br>- Discrete holomorphicity and integrability 
<br>- Lattice models and combinatorics 
<br>- Quantum integrability and  correlation functions 
<br><br> 


<br> Deadline for application: 30 November 2014.

<br> Late applications may be also considered.
